		<h3>New boiler: What to consider before buying</h3>
		<p>A boiler is the heart of a home’s central heating system, supplying heat to the radiators and hot water to the taps.</p>
		<p>It is a complicated and expensive piece of machinery, which works by burning gas to heat up water, before feeding it into the central heating pipework.</p>

		<h3>When should I consider buying a new boiler?</h3>
		<p>Unless you are upgrading your boiler, the chances are you are replacing an existing one because it is either broken or not functioning correctly.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, before you decide to swap your old boiler for a new one, it is worth getting a second opinion from a Gas Safe registered engineer, who will be able to check it for you and see if it can be repaired.</p>
		<p>It may be the case that a simple remedy is at hand, and it may be possible that an inexpensive solution is available.</p>
		<p>If your boiler cannot be repaired, they will be able to recommend the best type of boiler to replace it with, taking into consideration the size of your home and budget.</p>
		<p>You may also wish to replace your boiler if it is G-rated for energy efficiency, meaning it is wasting fuel and costing you more money on your heating bill.</p>
		<p>Installing a new boiler can also add value to your property if you are looking to rent it out or sell it, and it will also have an effect on the EPC rating of your property.</p>

		<h3>The fees for servicing your boiler</h3>
		<p>It is important to regularly service your boiler to make sure it is in good working order and to safeguard against potential problems in the future.</p>
		<p>Many boiler manufacturers also require an annual boiler service as part of the terms of their warranty.</p>
		<p>When it comes to the cost of a boiler service, expect to typically pay around £60-110, depending on the make and age of your boiler.</p>

		<h3>The expenses for repairing your boiler</h3>
		<p>In some cases, it may be possible – and makes more economical sense - to fix your boiler should it develop any faults.</p>
		<p>Should your boiler be in need of repair, parts aside, you can expect to pay from £50 upwards. For emergency call outs, prices typically start at £80.</p>

		<h3>The cost of a new boiler</h3>
		<p>Prices for a new boiler vary greatly, and can range from £600 to £3,000, and this is dependant on many different factors.</p>
		<p>These include what type of boiler it is, the size of the boiler and any additional costs that may result from the installation itself.</p>
		<p>What boiler you choose will also very much depend on your individual requirements and circumstances.</p>

		<h3>Pay monthly for your new boiler</h3>
		<p>Many heating companies offer finance packages to help spread the cost of buying a new boiler.</p>

		<h3>Save money with improved heating efficiency</h3>
		<p>It is no secret that a new boiler is a costly investment, but along with improved heating there are also many long-term financial benefits.</p>
		<p>Your new boiler could potentially save you money on your heating bill if it is more energy efficient than the one it replaces.</p>
		<p>Under EU guidelines, all new boilers must hold an energy efficiency rating of ‘A’.</p>
		<p>An A-rated boiler means it holds an energy rating of at least 88% compared to similar boilers.</p>

		<h4>Tips to save money on your bill</h4>
		<ul class="tick">
			<li>Along with replacing your boiler, there are many other, less expensive ways in which you can save money on your monthly bill</li>
			<li>Draught-proof your windows</li>
			<li>Insulate your loft / walls</li>
			<li>Insulate your windows</li>
			<li>Purchase a smart thermostat</li>

			<li>Move to a cheaper gas and electricity provider</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Boiler installation time</h3>
		<p>In many cases, HomeServe can recommend and install a new boiler in as little as 48 hours, depending on the type of boiler you choose.</p>
		<p>It may occasionally take up to three days to install a new boiler if it requires more work.</p>
		<p>For example: converting from a system boiler to a combi boiler, is a more complicated job than a straightforward upgrade.</p>
